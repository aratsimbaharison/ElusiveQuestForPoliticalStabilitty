### Political Stability Average and Trend for the Period of 1996-2017

#### Political stability average

The summary statistics of political stability shows that the world has been slightly stable during the period of 1996 to 2016, and the majority of the observations have been been stable:

- mean = 0.02312
- median = 0.15040

However, whle the maximum value of stability was only 1.9651, the minimum value was -3.3149.

The boxplot and histogram of political stability also demonstrate that the majority of the observations were positive, but there were some extreme values of instability (the histogram is skewed to the left).


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# The summary statistics of political stability estimate around the world

summary(WGIdevRegimeType$stability)


```


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The Political Stability Average of the World (1996-2016)"}

```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Frequency of Political Stability of the World (1996-2016)"}

```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Proportion of stability and instability for the whole world

stabilityProp <- table(WGIdevRegimeType$stabilityDummy)

```


#### Political stability by categories:



```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

stabilityByCat <- table(WGIdevRegimeType$stabilityCategory)
stabilityByCat
prop.table(stabilityByCat)

```


#### Political stability trend

When looking at the trend of political stability around the world for the period of 1996-2016, the table on the annual average of political stability was hovering around zero, although it has slightly delined in recent years.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# generating a table of political stability trend of the world for the period of 1996-2016

stabilityTrend <- WGIdevRegimeType %>%
  group_by(date) %>%

stabilityTrend

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap= "Trend of the Political Stability of the World for the Period of 1996-2016"}

# plotting the stability trend of the world

plot(stabilityTrend$date, stabilityTrend$stabilityAnnualAverage, type="o", lwd = 2,
     ylim=range( -1.5,1.5),
     xlab = "Years", ylab = "Political Stability")
abline(h = 0, lwd = 1.5)


```



### Political Stability by Region


- Political stability average by region



```{r echo= FALSE}

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# generating political stability average for each region of the world for the period of 1996-2016

politicalStabilityByRegion <- summarise(group_by(WGIdevRegimeType, region),
          mean=mean(stability, na.rm = TRUE), sd=sd(stability, na.rm = TRUE))
