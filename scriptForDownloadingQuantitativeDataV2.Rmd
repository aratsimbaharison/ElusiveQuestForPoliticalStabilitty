## Downloading and Cleaning the Data on World Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank Website:

Note concerning the country names and codes:
As we collected the data from the World Bank, we realized that the country names and codes were not consistent throughout the database and between the World Bank and other organizations, such as the United Nations.
Therefore, in order to be consistent throughout the data collection and analysis, we decided to adopt the World Bank country names and codes as explained in the following webpage: [API: Country Queries](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898590-api-country-queries)
The file `WBCountryIso2c_Iso3c_M49Code.csv` was created by hand based on the information provided by the World Bank.

# Downloading the WGI dataset (WGI2) from WGI Project homepage at: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/wgidataset_stata.zip. The stata file is already formated into country-year dataframe and directly usable. 
# In order to avoid different problems of connecting and downloading the data directly from the WGI Project homepage, using r commands, the dataset was first downloaded to a local repository under the file name "wgidataset.dta" and then read into r

WGI2 <- read_dta("wgidataset.dta")

# Selecting the variables of interest for this study by selecting their estimated values from the WGI dataset:
# Here is the list of the variables with their definition:
# stability (pve): Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism Estimate – capturing perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically‐motivated violence and terrorism.
# 
# voiceAndAccountability (vae): Voice and Accountability Estimate – capturing perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media.
# 
# governmentEffectiveness (gee): Government Effectiveness Estimate – capturing perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.
# 
# regulatoryQuality (rqe): Regulatory Quality Estimate – capturing perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development.
# 
# ruleOfLaw (rle): Rule of Law Estimate – capturing perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence.
# 
# corruptionControl (cce): Control of Corruption Estimate – capturing perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests.
